# HTML Lists, Control Flow 
 1. Ordered Lists - are lists where each item is listed with a number.
 1. Unorderd Lists - are lists that begin with a bullet point 
 1. Definition lists - are made up of a set of terms along withe definitions for each of those terms
## Lists
 - In HTML, a ol tags represents which type of list? Answer: **Ordered Lists**
 - In HTML, a ul tags represents which tyyp of list? Answer: **Unordered lists**
 - In HTML, a d1, dt, and dd tags are for defiing wihc list? Amswer: **Definition**
   (Nested lists contain lists within a list)
### Boxes
 1. Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control it apperance:
   - Border - separates the edge of one box from another box.
   - Margin - sit outside the edge of the border. You can define the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
   - Padding - is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
 1. If you want to create a rounded corner which property would you use? **border-radius**
 1. The display property has four options a. inline b. block c. inline-block d. none

#### Decisions and Loops

 * A conditional statements used in code make decisions on which code it will do next.
 * Comparasion operaters are used to compare two operands.
    Examples:
     * < less than
     * > greater than
     * = equal to
     * != not equal
     * <+ less than or equal to
     * >= greater than or equal to
  * Logical Operators   
     * && And
     * || Or
     * ! Not
  * Loops - Three kids of loops
      ** For - a counter is used to defined on how many times the loop will run. (used a lot with arrays)
      ** While - the loop will run unitl the condition is not longer true
      *** Do - runs at least once even if the condition is not meant.
      
   1. If..Else - If the first condition is true then excutes the code associated with that true
                 Else if the if condition is false than it will excute that code. Note Else IF is a nested IF Else statement,
