# Transforms CSS3
 - The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
 - The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

## 2D Rotate
 - The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. 
 
### 2D Scale
 - Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.

#### Transitions
 - As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. 
 - The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
 - Examples - Fade In, Change Color, Grow and Shrink
 ##### Pure CSS Bounce Animation
  - One example is a dropping ball that you can diplay on screen
