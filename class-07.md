# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions
 1. Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
 1. Constructor function is defined using a function expression. In other words, the variable EpicFailVideo is declared and then assigned a function with two parameters called epicRating and hasAnimals.
 1. When the function is called, the data inside these parameters are stored inside the this.epicRating and this.hasAnimals properties respectively. Storing data within properties ensures any newly created object can access that data later.
 1. After the constructor function definition, two objects are instantiated with the new keyword and their properties are initialized by calling the EpicFailVideo constructor function. After being instantiated and initialized, these objects are stored inside the parkourFail and corgiFail variables.
