## How the Web Works
> When you connect to the web you do it through an **Internet Service Provider** (ISP).
> ***Next*** your computer contacts a network of servers called **Domain Name System** (DNS), which contains the *IP Address* for the requested domain name.
> ***Next*** the IP Address from DNS is returned to **computer** which allows the web browser to contact the **web server** that hosts the website.
> ***Next*** the web server sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
